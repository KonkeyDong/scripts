# Backup Youtube Videos & Audio

With Youtube removing videos and platforms for what seems like politcal reasons, I made a wrapper script to download entire playlists or channels into either (the best possible) audio or video format.

Simply edit the `data.rb` file with URLs and directory names.

Note: The base directory drive is based off of **Linux** `/media` folder paths and named eHDDs off of a Raspberry Pi.

Requires [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) installed in order to work.
